# Welcome to the Future of Anime Market

## What is Anima?
Anima is the first permissionless manga funding platform, democratizing the funding required to turn manga into anime to reach a wider audience.
Anima allows anyone to propose and fund new anime projects without the need for prior approval or permission. The financial logic of the funding, investment and profit realization process is based on a blockchain, which means that it is open and transparent and that transactions are secured and validated by a distributed network of computers rather than a central authority. 

## Why was Anima built?
Our mission is to empower creators and fans of anime by providing a decentralized, open-source platform for funding and supporting the production of new anime projects. We believe in the power of community and the democratization of creative expression, and we strive to create a welcoming and inclusive space for all members of the anime community to come together and bring their ideas to life. Our goal is to foster a new generation of anime creators and to help bring fresh, innovative stories to the world. 

## How can I benefit from Anima?

### For Artists


The backbone of the platform is the indie artists that want to reach a wider audience at no cost. Anima provides 4 different advantages for artists:

**Stable Revenue**: Anima allows artists to generate revenue from their manga or anime as they reach a certain audience. The more views you get, the more you get paid. By crowdfunding projects directly, you can potentially achieve a greater degree of financial independence and stability, rather than relying on traditional funding sources that may come with certain strings attached.

**Direct funding**: Anima allows artists to directly solicit funding from a global audience, rather than relying on traditional gatekeepers or intermediaries to secure funding. Each manga you submit is tokenized and has a corresponding funding pool, if the pool reaches enough funding to cover the cost of a season, an animation offer is sent to the agencies and the pool money is used to fund animation expenses. This can be especially useful for artists who may have difficulty obtaining funding through more traditional channels.

**Greater creative control**: By bypassing traditional gatekeepers, artists can have greater control over their creative vision and the direction of their projects. This can be especially important for independent artists who may not have the same level of creative freedom within a more traditional production environment.

**The spotlight is yours**: Anima provides a new way for artists to reach and connect with a global audience, helping to increase their visibility and potentially leading to new opportunities.

The funding and revenue distribution process are completely autonomous and trustless, meaning as soon as your art reaches a certain level of engagement, the funding process is started as soon as the majority of investors agree for an anime version.


###  For Investors
**Increased transparency**: Because Anima operates on a blockchain, it offers a high level of transparency, which can help investors make informed decisions about their investments.

**Lower barriers to entry**: Anima typically have lower barriers to entry compared to more traditional investment opportunities, making it easier for investors to get involved.

**Potential for high returns**: By investing in projects at an early stage, investors may have the opportunity to realize higher returns if the project is successful.

### For readers

**Greater choice**: Anima offers a wide range of manga to choose from, enabling readers to support the types of anime stories that they are most interested in.

**Community involvement**: By participating in the funding process, readers can become more actively involved in the development of new anime projects and can potentially influence the direction of a project.
